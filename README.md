### **Kvar** is a pipeline for finding low frequency kmers in genomic data associated with disease. 

## Description

The overall goal is to find low-frequency and consensus-level kmers that are associated with certain disease phenotypes. So far we have outlined a pipeline for doing this in the slides and it goes something like: 1. get kmers; 2. filter kmers (based on frequency/location); and after running on a balanced set of disease & non-disease, 3. find kmers associated with disease phenotype. As a proof of principle, the team is using cancer samples pulled from WGS from NCI-60 cell lines (329 samples) using the SRA.
